# Xtern-Data-Science-Work-Prompt


Data Science Work Prompt
FoodX Background

One of the biggest aspects of the Xtern program is showing off our wonderful state and all it has to offer. Indiana is not only home to amazing sites and attractions, but also several local and unique dining options, like Food Trucks. TechPoint is excited to help amplify the Indiana Food Truck scene and will open our very own FoodX franchise and we need your help! In order to spread the Food Truck love, you will be asked to help develop the concept of amplifying the food truck scene in Indiana and helping to launch the franchise, FoodX. 

Your Task

In the next section, you will be given your corresponding responsibilities for the amplification of the Indiana Food Truck scene and/or the launch of the food truck franchise. Read each task carefully and ensure you submit your work by the deadline! 

Disclaimer: The above description is fictional.â€¯ The TechPoint team does not have an app or a food truck and is not using your work sample assessment to finalize features of it.â€¯ Any work completed will be used for the application to the Xtern internship.

Situation

In order to make the Xtern program the best summer internship program for the participants, the Data Science team is focusing its efforts on helping the Xterns to locate all the food trucks around the city. Given how capable the Data Science team is, the team also takes on the challenge to plan a fun foodie day for all the Xterns to go explore different food trucks with a schedule and travel plan.

Your Task

Utilize an open-source map API such as Google Map API, OpenStreetMap, AWS Map API to collect useful data on local food trucks. Clean and organize your data then present it as a table or data frame. Such table or data frame of local food trucks should contain basic information such as name, address, rating, website, open hour, and cuisine type. See Example_Data.csv for an example list.

Review the data and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set you gathered. Present a two-day weekend foodie plan with time, location name, address, cuisine, travel time, travel distance, transportation type and visualization of the travel route. The travel route is best visualized by building on your own. There are tons of Geographic information system packages in both python and R! See Example_Plan.csv for an example plan.

Demonstrate your findings using data visualization tools and well-written explanations. As an important member of the team, you get to come up with your own analysis and explain it! So try your best to dig out any useful information from the data set. Sky is the limit! ðŸ¤“

FAQ

What if I cannot download the data file?

If switching browsers does not resolve the issue, please reach out to x@techpoint.org and we will email you a direct copy of the file at our earliest convenience.
Where can I go find the data I needed?

Google is your friend! There are tons of free APIs that provide useful data around business locations and details.
Is there a required tool for the data analysis?

There is no required tool for the analysis, however, some tools may be better suited for this type of data and work. (Hint: R and Python)
Where should I submit my solution?

Your research and conclusions should be submitted as a link to a GitHub repository or Google Colab. It is encouraged that your repository hosts a Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook.
Oh no, this is so hard. Where should I start?

Data Science projects are complex and open-ended and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s super fun to come up with solutions. Take a deep breath and create a plan to meet the project requirements one by one. Everything will be ok!
